-- Description

"Adventure" is a small-scale text-based RPG platform. Desginers should create
an Adventure.py file (mimicking the one provided here) to design the game logic
for any game they want to create! Events (item usages and/or 
character interactions) can change just about anything! 
My hope is that educators use this to teach students simple programming and/or 
game design! At the very lest it teaches you just how complex games are :)



-- Instructions to play the game:

	Place Game.py, Adventure.py, and GamePrint.py in the same folder
	Navigate to that directory in Terminal/Powershell
	Resize shell to at least 75 chars
	enter "python Game.py"



-- Suggested Game Design flow:

	Play included Adventure to get a feel for the game
	Think of important items, characters, rooms, events, etc.
	Lay out a drawing of the map with characters/items
	Design the inital game-state 

	Rename Adventure.py to SampleAdventure.py
	Rename AdventureTemplate.py to Adventure.py
	Fill out the gameInit() function using your design
	TEST GAME by running "python Game.py"

	Add some game-state changes using character interactions and/or item usages
	TEST GAME
	Repeat until satisfied!
