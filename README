-- Instructions to play the game:

	Place Game.py, Adventure.py, and GamePrint in the same folder
	Navigate to that directory in Terminal/Powershell
	Resize shell to at least 75 chars
	enter "python Game.py"




-- Description

"Adventure" is a small-scale text-based RPG platform. Desginers should create
an Adventure.py file (mimicking the one provided here) to design the game logic
for any game they want to create! Because the item usage and character 
interaction functions have access to the entire state of the game, 
an event (item usage or character interaction) can change just about anything! 
My hope is that educators use this to teach students simple programming and/or 
game design! At the very lest it teaches you just how complex games are :)



-- Suggested Game Design flow:

	Play included Adventure to get a feel for the game

	Think of important items, character, rooms, events, etc.
	Lay out a drawing of the map
	Design the inital game-state
	TEST GAME by running "python Game.py"

	Add some game-state changes using character interactions and/or item usages
	TEST GAME
	Repeat until satisfied!
